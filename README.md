# üì± BetweenerApp: A Flutter Project

## ‚ú® Project Overview
Welcome to BetweenerApp! This repository hosts a new Flutter project, designed as a social media application focused on connecting users with people nearest to them. Users can easily discover, follow, and interact with others by sharing posts and engaging with content. Flutter, Google's versatile UI toolkit, enables us to build beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience across platforms.

This project aims to demonstrate core Flutter development principles and provide a solid starting point for building robust, cross-platform social applications.


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Flutter: The primary framework for building the cross-platform user interface.

- Dart: The programming language used for Flutter development.

- Backend : Likely for user authentication, real-time database (for posts, followers), and potentially location-based services.

- Location Services API: For identifying and connecting users based on their proximity.

- RESTful APIs: For communication between the app and the backend services.
